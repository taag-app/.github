## taag.app - Simplifying visual product link sharing for content creators.

[taag.app](https://www.taag.app) is a creator commerce platform that enables influencers and sellers to share monetized product links across social media and messaging apps.

Mainly focused on monetizing visual content and creating shoppable links. 
* Purpose: It allows content creators, influencers, and individuals to quickly turn their social media images into shoppable pages.
* Key Features:
    * Shoppable Galleries: Users can create a single, curated page displaying various products and services from their images.
    * Monetization: It helps users earn commission by linking directly to products or by generating affiliate revenue.
    * Single Link Sharing: The platform generates a single, shareable link that can be used across social media profiles, making it easier for followers to shop the looks or items featured.
    * Ease of Use: A quick setup process, the ability to create a shoppable page in under a minute.
    * How it works: You upload a photo to the app, and its Vision AI powered by Google automatically identifies and tags the products in the image.
    * The benefit: Instead of manually linking every item in a "Linktree" or responding to "Where did you get that?" comments, it generates one link where your followers can click on specific items in the photo to buy them.
