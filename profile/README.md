## taag.app - Simplifying visual product link sharing for content creators.

[taag.app](https://www.taag.app) is an AI creator commerce platform that enables influencers, creators, and sellers to transform images into interactive, monetized, shoppable experiences — all through a single shareable link.

We help creators turn engagement into revenue by making visual content instantly shoppable.

We are mainly focused on monetizing visual content and creating shoppable links.
* The Problem:
Creators constantly receive: “Where did you get that?”, “Link please?”, “Can you DM the product?”, “What brand is this?”

Traditional solutions like static link-in-bio tools don’t connect products directly to the image. Creators must manually list items, reply to comments, or build complicated affiliate pages. This creates friction. Friction kills conversions.

* Purpose: It allows content creators, influencers, and individuals to quickly turn their social media images into shoppable pages.
  
* Key Features:
    * Shoppable Galleries: Users can create a single, curated page displaying various products and services from their images.
    * Monetization: It helps users earn commission by linking directly to products or by generating affiliate revenue.
    * Single Link Sharing: The platform generates a single, short, shareable bio link that can be used across social media profiles, making it easier for followers to shop the looks or items featured.
    * Ease of Use: A quick setup process, the ability to create a shoppable page in under a minute.
    * How it works: You upload a photo to the app, and its Vision AI powered by Google automatically identifies and tags the products in the image.
    * The benefit: Instead of manually linking every item in a "Linktree" or responding to "Where did you get that?" comments, it generates one link where your followers can click on specific items in the photo to buy them.

* Who it is For:
  * Influencers
  * Content creators
  * Fashion stylists
  * Beauty bloggers
  * Home decor creators
  * Tech reviewers
  * Small businesses
  * Social sellers
  * Affiliate marketers
